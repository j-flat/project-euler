# Project Euler Challenge With VanillaJS
Here are my solutions to Project Euler's 50+ first problems, implemented using pure VanillaJS, without external libraries. 

Project setup includes Jest as testing framework and all implementations are done with Test Driven Development methodology. 

Solutions to problems can be found from folders prefixed with the _ID/Number_ of the problem. All folders include also `README.md` where is the problem description.

Project root includes index.js which makes it possible to run any function provided with arguments.

**Note!** Implementations might be improved overtime.
